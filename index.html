		    					<span class="position"><b>Inclusivity<b></span>
		    					<p>My first goal every semester is to create an inclusive environment so every student feels comfortable, regardless of age, race, ethnicity, nationality, sex, 
								gender identity, sexuality, or disability. It is an unfortunate fact that higher education, and chemistry specifically, suffer from the ‘leaky pipeline’, 
								in which people from underrepresented backgrounds are pushed out of the field, be it from discomfort, harassment, isolation, or more harmful policies. Growing up 
								as a queer person of color, and being the first in my family to go to college, studying science didn’t seem possible until a few professors reached out and showed 
								their confidence in me. Now, I want to continue the process for my students every chance I get. There has been plenty of research showing the importance of 
								inclusivity and comfort of students in their academic performance. To achieve this, I have attended workshops and trainings in inclusivity to improve my own 
								understanding of different backgrounds and perspectives. In the classroom, this takes multiple forms; on a “simpler” level, beginning every semester by introducing 
								myself, including my own background and identities and my preferred name and pronouns. In this way, I hope students recognize not only my own intersectionality, but 
								also that I am comfortable talking about these things and that they can be comfortable talking to me about them. Additionally, by surveying students early on, I can 
								determine what they need from me to give them the best chance possible at succeeding in the class, and when providing additional resources (i.e. online readings or 
								videos) I can ensure they come from a diverse group of creators who probe the material in different ways and at different starting levels of understanding. And lastly,
								asking for feedback regularly, and updating my practices accordingly, to show I recognize that every group of students is unique and I cannot use the same methods 
								and material every semester.  
							</p> 
	    					</div>
	    				</div>
					    	<div class="text pl-3">
		    					<h3>Multi-Modal Student Engagement</h3>
		    					<p>Through improving feelings of inclusivity in the classroom, and with additional practices, I also hope to improve student engagement in lectures and in-class activities. 
								It’s well known how important student involvement is in their own learning and in their comfort on a university campus. To this end, I have and will continue to provide 
								students multiple ways to engage with the me, the material, and each other. While the “ideal” scenario would be for all students to attend every class and actively 
								participate every time, there are many reasons why they might not be able to: outside responsibilities keeping them away, personal health struggles, needing additional 
								time to process material before being comfortable with it, or even just discomfort and anxieties about in-class participation. Because of this, all lecture notes are 
								made available virtually, before the class starts so students can review it ahead of time and prepare any questions they have. Also streaming and recording every class 
								section, with captions and transcripts available, so any student who cannot physically be in the classroom can still have the same experience, and can send messages in 
								real time if needed. And lastly, office hours are greatly encouraged, and always flexible in days, times, and modalities to reach every student possible.
							</p> 
						</div>
						<div class="text pl-3">
		    					<h4>Transferrable Skills</sh4>
		    					<p>My final goal in teaching, especially at the university level, is for every student to feel like they gained something useful out of the class. Most of them probably won’t 
								need to remember the equations for calculating enthalpy or reaction kinetics after they finish their degrees, and that inevitably leads to questions of why they’re 
								learning it now, or why this class is necessary for them to take. Because of this, I believe it’s always important to remind students of the bigger picture takeaways. 
								Showing them that by completing the assignments they’re also learning skills in problem solving, time management, and the ability to communicate complex concepts in a 
								way that their fellow classmates and us as instructors will understand, among others. Encouraging students to talk about the class to non-chemistry friends and family 
								I believe really helps them grasp this idea, as they have to not only explain the concepts themselves, but relate it to the outside world in order to prove its 
								importance. Additionally, in future classes I lead, I plan to always incorporate at least one project in which they take an issue facing the world today, and relate 
								it back to the concepts we are studying in class.

							<b>Semesters:</b> Fall 2018 (3 sections), Spring 2019 (3 sections), Fall 2019 (3 sections)
							<br><b>Enrollment:</b> Each section had 25-30 undergraduate students
							<br><b>Course Description:</b> These lab courses aid in student understanding of the concepts taught in the General Chemistry lectures through the use of simply chemistry 
							experiments. The experiments teach basic chemistry lab skills, and provide a visualization and hands-on understanding of the lecture material. 
							<br><b>Teaching Responsibilites:</b>
							<p>My primary role in this course was to supervise and assist students as they performed weekly chemistry experiments. This included preparing for the lab each week in the 
								form of ensuring necessary supplies were provided, and aiding the Instructor of Record in the preceding workshop where we guided the students through the concepts 
								that would be covered during the experiment and had them complete relevant sample calculations. I was responsible for grading each students workshop calculations 
								and lab reports each week, and hosted office hours to assist them as needed.  Additionally, after noticing students were struggling with portions of the lab reports 
								that required Excel, I began to offer an additional evening or weekend workshop to cover the basic functions and ensure all students were comfortable with the program.
